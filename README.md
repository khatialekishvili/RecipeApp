## Angular Recipe App
A responsive Angular web application that allows users to view, search, add, edit, favorite, and delete recipes.
The project demonstrates clean architecture, Angular best practices, and practical UI implementation.

## What This App Does
• Displays a dynamic list of recipes with a built-in search bar for filtering by title, description, or ingredients.
• Fetches recipes from a mock JSON Server API (http://localhost:3000/recipes) using Angular’s HttpClient.
    - All recipe data is stored in db.json at the project root.
    - On app load, a GET request retrieves all recipes, which are then cached locally in a BehaviorSubject for fast access.
• Implements instant, client-side search:
    - If recipes are already cached, filtering happens immediately without extra network calls.
    - If not, the service fetches data from the API before applying search filters.
• Displays a detailed page for each recipe, including title, description, ingredients, and image.
    - Includes a favorite toggle that updates both the backend and the local cache.
    - Provides edit and delete actions, with confirmation dialogs before deletion.
• Allows users to add new recipes through a form. New entries are marked with isUser: true and stored in the mock backend.
• Supports editing existing recipes via a simple PATCH request.
• Persists favorite recipes by sending patch updates to the API and synchronizing the local cache.
• Handles deletion in two ways:
    - User-added recipes are deleted from the backend.
    - Pre-loaded recipes are filtered out locally (so they remain in db.json for future sessions).
• Uses Angular Router for navigation between list, detail, add, and edit pages.
• Uses RxJS and Angular Signals for efficient data flow, reducing unnecessary component reloads.
• Provides clear user feedback through Angular Material dialogs and snackbars.


 ## How to Run the App
1. Install dependencies
npm install
2. Start the mock API
npm run api
3. Start the Angular app
npm start

📝Run both commands in separate terminals. The API must be running for the recipe list to load.


## Technologies & Tools Used
 • Angular 17+ (Standalone Components)
 • RxJS & async pipe for data streams and error handling
 • Signals for local state management in the list view
 • Angular Material for UI elements (buttons, icons, toggles, dialogs, spinners)
 • Dialogs for confirmation before delete
 • JSON Server for a quick mock backend
 • SCSS for styling and responsive design
